# PA193 Buggy Code Example

This repository is an example project with intentionally buggy code to demonstrate the use of automatic static analysis via GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to set up and use GitHub Actions for automatic static code analysis. By integrating static analysis tools into your CI/CD pipeline, you can catch potential issues early in the development process.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kindejak/PA193-buggycode-python.git
    cd PA193-buggycode
    ```

2. **Set up GitHub Actions:**
    - Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
    - Review the existing workflow files or create a new one to configure your static analysis tools.

## Static Analysis Tools

This project uses the following static analysis tools:

- **Tool 1:** Codacy

## Running Static Analysis

To run the static analysis tools locally, use the following commands:

...

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run the static analysis tools automatically on each push and pull request. You can find the workflow configuration in the `.github/workflows` directory.
